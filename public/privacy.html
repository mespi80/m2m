      <strong>Activity and training data.</strong> When you connect third-party accounts (for example, Garmin Connect) or manually log activities, we collect 
      information about your endurance sessions and related metrics, such as:
      <ul>

      intensity, recovery estimates, predicted race times, and plan adherence, to support training-plan generation and monitoring.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Usage information.</strong> We collect information about how you interact with the Services, such as the pages you view, features you use,
